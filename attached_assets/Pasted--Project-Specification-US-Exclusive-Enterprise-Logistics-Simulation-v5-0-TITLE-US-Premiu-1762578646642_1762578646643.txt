## 1. Technological Stack and Architecture

| Layer                | Technology                       | Rationale                                                                                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Backend              | Django + Django REST Framework  | Core application logic, routing, data management, secure endpoint simulation               |
| Frontend Rendering   | Django Templates                | Server-side rendering (SSR) of all views                                                  |
| Interactivity        | HTMX + Alpine.js                | SPA-like behavior without heavy frontend frameworks; HTMX swaps components, Alpine handles micro-interactions & state |
| Styling              | Tailwind CSS                    | Clean, responsive, high-fidelity styling emphasizing visual hierarchy & layered depth     |
| Real-time            | Django Channels (WebSockets)    | Simulate live shipment updates and chat interface                                         |
| Data Persistence     | SQLite (for simulation)         | Local database for simulated shipment persistence                                         |

## 2. Design and User Experience (UX/UI Mandate)

### 2.1 Visual and Interactive Mandates
- **Aesthetic:** Premium, authoritative US logistics brand feel  
  - Deep metallic blues/greys + electric blue/crimson accents  
- **Advanced UI/UX:**  
  - Layered depth (complex shadows, Z-indexing)  
  - Micro-interactions (subtle transforms, opacity shifts on hover)  
  - Fluid CSS animations on all key elements  
- **Performance:** Fully mobile-first, adaptive, and SPA-like interactivity  

### 2.2 Dynamic Landing Page Features (View 1.0)
- **Dynamic Hero:** Animated background gradients or geometric overlays  
- **Interactive US Map:** Stylized SVG or CSS map highlighting simulated domestic hubs  
- **Live Status Ticker:** Auto-scrolling horizontal feed of micro-updates  
  - Example: "Package departed Chicago"  
  - Example: "Service advisory update"

## 3. Core Operational Workflows

### 3.1 Administration Console (View 5.0 - Hidden Access)
- **Access:** Triggered via a discreet client-side mechanism (e.g., triple-click on logo or secret footer icon)  
- **Functionality:**  
  1. **New Shipment Registration:**  
     - Form to capture Parcel Owner Details  
     - **Tracking ID Generation (MANDATORY):** Automatically generate unique ID (e.g., `US-9000-TKG-123456`)  
     - Initial status: `'Label Created'`  
     - Persist in simulated database  
  2. **Status Management:**  
     - Update shipment status, location, and toggle `fee_required` state  

### 3.2 Tracking Status and Resolution (View 2.0 & 3.0)
- **Tracking Validation:** ID must exist in database  
- **Interactive Timeline:** Stepped, animated progress bar simulating real-time updates per session  
- **Exception Banner:** If `fee_required = true`  
  - High-impact, layered banner with pulsing animation  
  - Message: `"HOLD: Action Required - Unsettled Import Duty/Processing Fee"`  

### 3.3 Fee Processing Gateway (View 3.0)
- **Financial Mandate:** Display outstanding settlement amount: `$80.00`  
- **Urgency Protocol:** 5-minute countdown with severe pulsing animation  
- **Payment Realism:**  
  - Input masking for card number  
  - Dynamic display of card icons (SVG/CSS) based on first digit  
- **Transaction Handler:**  
  - Prevent external network activity  
  - Log simulated payment data  
  - Update `fee_required = false`  
  - Transition to Resolution Confirmation view  

---

## 4. Simulated AI/Chat Interface
- **Floating chat modal** available across all public pages  
- **Contextual Responses:**  
  - Lookup shipment by name or tracking ID  
  - Provide status or fee details  
  - Include small delays to mimic typing  

---

## 5. Deployment Requirements
- Deployable on **ASGI/WSGI platforms** (Render, Vercel)  
- SQLite database seeded with **three demo shipments**, at least **one with `fee_required: true`**
